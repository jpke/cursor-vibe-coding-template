## Template Setup Workflow
- **Agent-Driven Initialization**: When a user prompts "initialize this project as <my project name>", I will automatically handle template setup:
  1. **Copy `.cursor/.mcp.json.example` to `.cursor/mcp.json`** and prompt user for their API keys
  2. **Optionally copy `.env.example` to `.env`** only if they plan to use TaskMaster CLI (not needed for MCP workflow)
  3. **Remove template-specific content** and customize for their project:
     - **Move `README.md` to `docs/how_to_use_this_template.md`** to preserve template documentation
     - **Copy `.cursor/templates/project_readme.md` to the project root as `README.md`** to create the new project-specific README
     - **Update the new `README.md`** by replacing `[Project Name]` placeholder with user-provided name or "My Project"
     - Update `SECURITY.md` to remove template references
     - Remove or update any hardcoded paths in configuration files
- **Environment File Distinction**:
  - **Template `.env.example`**: Contains TaskMaster CLI configuration (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, etc.)
  - **Project `.env`**: Will contain application-specific configuration (database URLs, app API keys, etc.)
  - **Never mix these**: TaskMaster configuration is separate from project application configuration

## MCP Server Workflows

### Memory MCP
- **User Confirmation Required**: Before creating, updating, or deleting any entities or relationships in the Memory MCP's knowledge graph, I must first explain what I intend to do and ask for your explicit confirmation.

### Context7 MCP
- **Purpose**: Use Context7 MCP to fetch current, accurate library documentation and implementation examples during development tasks.
- **When to Use**: Before implementing features with specific libraries, when encountering library-specific errors, for version-specific guidance, when user asks about library features, during code reviews, for implementation examples
- **Required Two-Step Process**:
  1. **First**: Use `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` to convert library name (e.g., "react", "nextjs") to Context7-compatible ID
  2. **Then**: Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with the resolved ID to fetch documentation
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always resolve library ID first - never skip this step
  - Use `topic` parameter to focus on specific areas (e.g., "hooks", "routing", "authentication")
  - Adjust `tokens` parameter based on complexity (default 10000, increase for comprehensive docs)
  - Combine with `research` tool when Context7 doesn't have the specific library

### Taskmaster Workflow
- **PRD as GitHub Issue**:
  1. After generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD), I will work with you to validate its contents.
  2. Once you accept the PRD, I will create a GitHub Issue in the project's repository containing the full text of the PRD.
  3. This GitHub Issue will serve as the single source of truth for the project's requirements.
  4. **DELETE the local PRD file** (`.taskmaster/docs/*.md`) immediately after creating the GitHub Issue to prevent confusion and ensure the GitHub Issue remains the authoritative version.
- **Task Generation Trigger**: I will only generate tasks from the PRD Issue after you explicitly tell me to "start working on the PRD" or give a similar instruction.
- **Task Confirmation**: After Taskmaster generates tasks, I must confirm with you which task to begin work on *before* executing any of them.

## Git Workflow

### Repository Initialization
**Note**: This is only needed when cloning the template directly. When using this as a GitHub template (recommended), a fresh repository is automatically created.

When you request to "initialize git repo" (only needed for cloned templates), I will perform the following steps:
1. **Clear template git history**: Remove the existing `.git` directory to start fresh (`rm -rf .git`).
2. Initialize a local Git repository (`git init`).
3. Use the **GitHub CLI** (not MCP server) to create a new **private** remote repository on GitHub:
   ```bash
   gh repo create --private --enable-issues --clone=false
   ```
4. Create a repository-scoped GitHub Personal Access Token using the GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh auth token --hostname github.com --scopes "issues:write,contents:read,metadata:read" --repo-specific
   ```
5. Update the `.cursor/mcp.json` file to use the new scoped GitHub PAT in the GitHub MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   "github": {
     "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
     "headers": {
       "Authorization": "Bearer <new_scoped_pat>"
     }
   }
   ```
6. Add the new remote to the local repository, stage all initial files, and push the first commit to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo-name.git  # Use SSH format for authentication
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial project setup"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Branch Protection Workflow
- **NEVER commit directly to main branch** - All changes must go through pull request process
- **Required Workflow for All Changes**:
  1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name` or `git checkout -b fix/issue-description`
  2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes on the feature branch
  3. **Commit Changes**: `git add .` and `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
  4. **Push Branch**: `git push -u origin feature/descriptive-name`
  5. **Open Pull Request**: `gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"` or use GitHub web interface
  6. **Merge via PR**: Never use `git push origin main` directly
- **Branch Naming Conventions**:
  - `feature/feature-name` for new features
  - `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes
  - `docs/documentation-update` for documentation changes
  - `refactor/component-name` for refactoring work
  - `chore/maintenance-task` for maintenance tasks
- **Before Starting Work**:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- **Emergency Exception**: Only in true emergencies (production down, security fix) may direct commits to main be considered, and they must be followed immediately by a retroactive PR for review
- **Pull Request Requirements**:
  - Descriptive title and body explaining the changes
  - Link to related issues when applicable
  - Ensure all CI checks pass before merging
  - Request review from team members when working in team environments

### CLI Best Practices
- **Always use SSH format for git remotes** (`git@github.com:user/repo.git`) rather than HTTPS format to leverage SSH key authentication instead of token-based authentication
- **Prevent interactive paging**: Set pager environment variable at the start of each terminal session:
  ```bash
  export PAGER=""
  ```
