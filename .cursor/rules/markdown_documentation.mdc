# Markdown Documentation Standards

## Core Principles
- **Accuracy**: All information must be current, tested, and factually correct
- **Conciseness**: Communicate maximum value with minimum words
- **Professionalism**: Use clear, consistent tone and proper formatting

## Content Organization

### Information Hierarchy
- **Lead with value**: Most critical information in first 2-3 paragraphs
- **Progressive disclosure**: Details follow overview, specifics follow general
- **Scannable structure**: Use headings, bullets, and whitespace strategically

### Content Quality
- **Eliminate duplication**: Each piece of information appears once
- **Link don't repeat**: Reference other sections rather than duplicating content
- **Update holistically**: When changing one section, review related sections

## Structure Requirements

### Navigation
- **Table of Contents**: For files >200 lines or >5 main sections
- **Consistent headings**: Use semantic hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- **Cross-references**: Link related sections and external resources

### Formatting Standards
- **Code blocks**: Always specify language (`json`, `bash`, `typescript`)
- **Lists**: Use bullets for items, numbers for sequential steps
- **Tables**: For structured data comparison
- **Callouts**: Use `>` for important notes, warnings, or tips

## File-Specific Guidelines

### README.md
1. **Hook**: Project purpose in first sentence
2. **Quick start**: Installation/usage in first section
3. **Core features**: Key functionality overview
4. **Developer info**: Setup, contributing, license

### Technical Documentation
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge, tools, versions
- **Examples**: Working code snippets, not pseudo-code
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues with solutions
- **References**: Links to official docs, RFCs, specifications

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Information is current and accurate
- [ ] No duplicate content across sections
- [ ] Most important info appears early
- [ ] Structure enables quick scanning
- [ ] All code examples work as written
- [ ] Links are functional and relevant
