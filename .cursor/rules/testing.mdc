- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach where possible. At a minimum, ensure that unit tests are created or updated for any new or modified code.
  - All tests must be passing before a coding task is considered complete.
  - All test reports, artifacts, and error logs must be output to a common `tests_output/` directory at the project root.
